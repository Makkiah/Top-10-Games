# Top-10-Games
A small, self-choice, project that's apart of a web dev course I purchased. I love video games so i opted to make a Top 10 list. The images, descriptions, and fun-facts of each game were used from IGN's Top 100 list. However, I edited the descriptions to summarize. Other than those things, all of this site was coded &amp; created by myself.
