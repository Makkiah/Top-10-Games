		<br>
		<p >Games are the whole reason I entered into the web development atmosphere. <br>
		My goal is to create a website for all gamers where there&apos;s both a asense of community and trustworthy sources for games.<br>
		As a kid, and even now as an adult, games were a haven and a form of interactive&ndash;meditation for me.<br>
		Throughout my entire life, video&ndash;games have given me hope, friends, perspective, and enough entertainment to keep me in my room for days on end.<br>
		I don&apos;t expect everyone else to understand the insumountable impact games can have on a persons life, but I know there are a large commnity of gamers who share this stress&ndash;releasing hobby. <br>
		I just hope you enjoyed reading over this &lsquo;Top 10 Games of All Time&rsquo; list and encourage you to give at least one a try. I promise, you won&apos;t regret it.<br>
